## Project Ideas

### Bot

Make a bot that does multiple commands

Make the user have to input a choice that is then connected to a function that is executed

Something that is connected to all the functions shown before.

Optional:

Have some fancy colors (makes any script more exciting!)

Make a calculator (+-*/), take 3 inputs, two numbers and one operator

#### Harder Tasks

* Make the bot in a switch case
* Take use of while loop to make it
* Add another choice
  * Rättstavade ord
    * Computer outputs a word "Hej på dig Igelkott", user types in co-responding: "he jpå Dig Igelkorr". The following is wrong 'j' in hej, 'P' in på, 'D' in dig, 'rr' in Igelkott. Then you can calcualte that 5 characters are wrong out of 16, 5/16 = ~31% error, eller ~69% rättstavat.
  * Type racer
    * Use of the 'time' function to time from the start. Then type out a sentence and see how fast the user is
